# gask's CLI tools

I've long since maintained a collection of scrappy command line programs that 
I've written over the past few years, mostly to aid in programming or 
otherwise. As time has gone on my private repository has turned into kind of a 
mess, enough so that I'm reluctant to give it to people whenever they ask me 
about some of the programs I use. Thus, I'm rewritting them all, and dumping 
them into this public repo for ease of use. Hooray.

At some point in the future, once this repo has substance, I'll write 
individual descriptions and manuals for everything.
